# Quiz Game System

The **Quiz Game System** is an engaging and educational console-based application developed in Java. It provides users with an interactive platform to participate in quizzes, answer multiple-choice questions, and track their scores in real time. The system is designed to demonstrate principles of Java programming, including file handling and randomization, while delivering a fun and dynamic experience.

## Features

### 1. Player Registration
- Users can register with their name and a unique identifier (e.g., email or username).

### 2. Quiz Gameplay
- **Dynamic Questions**: Questions are displayed randomly from a question bank.
- **Multiple Choice**: Each question has four options to choose from.
- **Score Tracking**: Scores are updated for correct answers.
- **Optional Timer**: A countdown timer (10-30 seconds per question) can be implemented for added challenge.

### 3. Question Storage
- Questions can be fetched dynamically using one of the following methods:
  - **File Handling**: Local storage in text or JSON files.
  - **Database Integration**: Retrieval from a database categorized by difficulty or topic.
  - **API Integration**: Fetching questions from an external API like Open Trivia API.

### 4. Scoreboard
- Final score summary is displayed at the end of the quiz.
- A leaderboard compares scores among multiple players.

### 5. Robust Error Handling
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- Provides connectivity issue alerts when using APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language for logic and implementation.
- **File Handling**: Persistent storage of questions and scores.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Modular design using classes and methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above.
- Any IDE or text editor with Java support (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-game-system.git
   cd quiz-game-system
   ```

2. **Prepare the Question File**:
   - Create a `questions.txt` file in the following format:
     ```
     Question Text;Option 1;Option 2;Option 3;Option 4;Correct Option Number
     ```
     Example:
     ```
     What is the capital of France?;Paris;London;Berlin;Madrid;1
     Who developed Java?;Microsoft;Sun Microsystems;Apple;Google;2

   ```bash
   javac QuizGame.java
   java QuizGame
   ```

## Project Files

- **QuizGame.java**: The main application logic.
- **Question.java**: A class to represent individual questions.
- **questions.txt**: A text file containing quiz questions.

## Future Enhancements
